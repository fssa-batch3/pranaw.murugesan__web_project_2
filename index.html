        <h1>Anonymous</h1>
        <p>Well, who doesn’t know about the infamous hackers group Anonymous. The decentralized group originated in 2003.
          It is a leaderless organisation which projects itself as the cyber guardian of human rights and vows to fight
          against injustice through the weapon of “hacking”. Known for projecting itself as a vigilante group the
          members of the group are recognized by The use of Guy Fawkes Mask which seems to be inspired by the movie “V
          for Vendetta”. Initially the group is believed to have a loosely self-agreed goal of entertainment, a series
          of protests Anonymous held against the Church of Scientology in 2008 the group started focussing on a number
          of international issues involving Islamic State, Wikileaks, Child Pornography, Copyright Protection, Occupy
          Movement etc.</p>
        <h1>Lapsus$</h1>
        <p>Lapsus$, stylised as LAPSUS$ and classified by Microsoft as DEV-0537 is an international extortion-focused hacker group known for its various cyberattacks against companies and government agencies. Unlike most hacker groups, Lapsus$ is known for using the messaging app Telegram for communications to the public, including recruitment and posting sensitive data from their victims, although the group's usage of Telegram has diminished. The composition of the group has also been noted, with at least two of the members being teenagers. Lapsus$' attack vector is through social engineering; once the group has gained the credentials to a privileged employee within the target organisation, the group then attempts to obtain sensitive data through a variety of means, including using remote desktop tools.</p>
        <h1>Conti</h1>
        <p>Though it allegedly shut down in May 2022, the remnants of the Conti ransomware gang breached the systems of the Costa Rican government, launched Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on Cobalt Strike servers, and attacked the Ukrainian government, as well as other Ukrainian and European humanitarian and nonprofit organizations amid Russia’s war in the region. The group declared support for Russia earlier in the year before walking back its full support. Google's Threat Analysis Group noted in a blog that Conti phishing emails were sent out impersonating the National Cyber Police of Ukraine and contained a link that urged targets to download an update for their operating system. At the same time, the attack itself included the deployment of banking Trojan IcedID to steal personal data.</p>
        <h1>Lazarus Group</h1>
        <p>North Korean state-linked hacker collective Lazarus Group has had quite the year, and that’s before the U.S. government confiscated $30 million worth of cryptocurrency it stole in a token-based, play-to-earn game scheme in early 2022. Between February and July 2022, Lazarus targeted a series of energy providers by exploiting vulnerabilities in VMWare Horizon and malware to gain initial access to the organizations, primarily in Canada, Japan, and the United States.The campaign was partially disclosed by a handful of security firms, but a technical report says Lazarus’s method was to “establish initial footholds into enterprise networks, followed by the deployment of the group's custom malware implants, VSingle and YamaBot. In addition to these known malware families, we have also discovered the use of a previously unknown malware implant we’re calling ‘MagicRAT.</p>
