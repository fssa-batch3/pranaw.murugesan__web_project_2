    <!-- Who is a hacker part -->
    <h1 id="hacker">Who is a hacker</h1>
    <p>A hacker is ideally a person who is skilled in information technology. He uses his technical knowledge to
      overcome an obstacle or sometimes even achieve a goal within a computerized system. However, in recent
      times, the term hacker is always associated with a security hacker – someone who is always on the lookout
      for ways to acquire and exploit sensitive personal, financial and organizational information, which is
      otherwise not accessible to them. Legitimate figures often use hacking for legal purposes.</p>
      <!-- How does hacking works part -->
    <h1 id="howDoesHackingWorks">How does Hacking Work?</h1>
    <p>Hackers are highly skilled in breaching securities to gain unauthorized access to phones, tablets, computers, IoT
      devices, networks, or the networking system of an entire organization. They are generally very proficient in
      exploiting weaknesses in network security, taking advantage of the same. These weaknesses can be technical or
      social in nature.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Technical weaknesses: Hackers are extremely talented in exploiting software vulnerabilities or weak security
        practices. They do this to gain unauthorized access or even sometimes to inject malware that would crumple the
        entire system.</li>
      <li>Social weaknesses: This kind of social engineering is done to convince those with privileged access to click
        on malicious links, open infected files, or reveal personal information. This allows them access to otherwise
        hardened infrastructures.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Computers and the Internet have changed the work environment of the world beyond imagination. Computers on taking
      over a major part of our lives, all our data has got transferred from records and ledgers to computers. Though
      this kind of shift in working has reduced the physical burden on workers it has also increased the chances of data
      theft. People involved in stealing data or harming the systems are knowledgeable people with wrong intentions
      known as Hackers. There are different types of hackers. Let’s take a look at how many types of hackers are there
      and the types of hacker attacks and techniques.</p>

      <!-- White hat hacker part  -->
    <h1 id="white">Who is White Hat</h1>
    <p>A white hat hacker -- or ethical hacker -- is an individual who uses hacking skills to identify security
      vulnerabilities in hardware, software or networks. However, unlike black hat hackers -- or malicious hackers --
      white hat hackers respect the rule of law as it applies to hacking. Many white hat hackers are former black hat
      hackers. The terms come from old Western movies, where heroes often wore white hats and the bad guys wore black
      hats. White hat hackers only seek vulnerabilities or exploits when they are legally permitted to do so. White hat
      hackers may do their research on open source software, as well as on software or systems they own or have been
      authorized to investigate, including products and services that operate bug bounty programs.</p>
      
      <!-- Gray hat hacker  -->
    <h1 id="gray">Who is a Gray Hat</h1>
    <p>Somewhere between white and black are gray hat hackers. Gray hat hackers enact a blend of both black hat and
      white hat activities. Gray hat hackers often look for vulnerabilities in a system without the owner's permission
      or knowledge. If issues are found, they report them to the owner, sometimes requesting a small fee to fix the
      problem. Some gray hat hackers like to believe they are doing something good for companies by hacking their
      websites and invading their networks without permission. Still, company owners rarely appreciate unauthorized
      forays into their business information infrastructure. Often, a gray hat's real intention is to show off their
      skills and gain publicity — maybe even appreciation — for what they consider a contribution to cybersecurity.</p>

      <!-- Black hat hacker -->
    <h1 id="black">Who is a Black Hat</h1>
    <p>Black hat hackers often develop specialties, such as phishing or managing remote access tools. Many get their
      "jobs" through forums and other connections on the dark web. Some develop and sell malicious software themselves,
      but others prefer to work through franchises or leasing arrangements – again, similar to the legitimate business
      world.Hacking has become an integral intelligence-gathering tool for governments, but it is more common for black
      hat hackers to work alone or with organized crime organizations for easy money.</p>

        <!-- Stages of Hacking part -->
    <h1 id="stages">Stages of Hacking</h1>
    <h3>Reconnaissance</h3>
    <p>This is the first step of Hacking. It is also called as Footprinting and information gathering Phase. This is the
      preparatory phase where we collect as much information as possible about the target.</p>
    <p>We usually collect information about three groups,</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Network</li>
      <li>Network</li>
      <li>Host</li>
      <li>People involved</li>
      <p>There are two types of Footprinting:</p>
      <li>Active: Directly interacting with the target to gather information about the target. Eg Using Nmap tool to
        scan
        the target</li>
      <li>Passive: Trying to collect the information about the target without directly accessing the target. This
        involves
        collecting information from social media, public websites etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <!-- How Scanning workd -->
    <h3>Scanning</h3>
    <p>Here, Three types of scanning are involved:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Port Scanning This phase involves scanning the target for the information like open ports, Live systems,
        various services running on the host.</li>
      <li>Vulnerability Scanning: Checking the target for weaknesses or vulnerabilities which can be exploited. Usually
        done with help of automated tools</li>
      <li>Network Mapping: Finding the topology of network, routers, firewalls servers if any, and host information and
        drawing a network diagram with the available information. This map may serve as a valuable piece of information
        throughout the haking process.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Gaining Access part starts here -->
    <h3>Gaining Access</h3>
    <p>This phase is where an attacker breaks into the system/network using various tools or methods. After entering
      into a system, he has to increase his privilege to administrator level so he can install an application he needs
      or modify data or hide data.</p>

      <!-- Maintaing Access part starts here -->
    <h3>Maintaining Access</h3>
    <p>Hacker may just hack the system to show it was vulnerable or he can be so mischievous that he wants to maintain
      or persist the connection in the background without the knowledge of the user. This can be done using Trojans,
      Rootkits or other malicious files. The aim is to maintain the access to the target until he finishes the tasks he
      planned to accomplish in that target.</p>
    <h3>Clearing Tracks</h3>
    <p>
      No thief wants to get caught. An intelligent hacker always clears all evidence so that in the later point of time,
      no one will find any traces leading to him. This involves modifying/corrupting/deleting the values of Logs,
      modifying registry values and uninstalling all applications he used and deleting all folders he created.</p>
